I'm a graduate student in Machine Learning, supervised by David Barber at UCL.
I'm interested in inference in graphical models and deep learning as well as artificial
intelligence more broadly and what that may mean for society.

Before Joining David's group I did a masters in Machine Learning at UCL and before that
I was an undergraduate physicist at Cambridge.
