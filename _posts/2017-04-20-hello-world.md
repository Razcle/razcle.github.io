Hello World!

This is my first blog post. My name is Raza Habib and I'm a PhD student at UCL
studying Machine Learning under [David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php).

I'm interested in Artificial (General) Intelligence, Machine Learning, Physics and the Philosophy of
Science.

This blog will be a mixture of shorter technical posts explaining important ideas
within machine learning interspersed with more speculative musings about the bigger picture
questions that arise when studying computational intelligence.

The layout of this blog is heavily inspired by [Dustin Tran's](http://dustintran.com/) blog.
