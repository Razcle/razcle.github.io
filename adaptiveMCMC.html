  <section class="post-content"><p>The goal of adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo is to develop 
more efficient samplers by adapting the Markov transition operator during
sampling.</p>

<p>An easy mistake to make is to think that as long as during adaptation the Markov
operator always has the correct stationary distribution then the overall sampler will be correct
but this is not true. Here’s a simple intuitive example that shows that this is not correct.
Imagine that we wish to sample from a Bernoulli distribution  where each state has an equal probability of 
being sampled. We could doing this by simulating from the Markov chain shown in the picture below. The arrows 
represent possible transitions and their probabilities.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/adaptivemcmc.png" alt="my plot" /></p>

<p>It’s clear by symmetry that if we start in state 1 and hop along the arrows according to the
probabilities shown, that we’ll spend an equal amount of time in both states no matter what the value of <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> is. So following
this Markov chain would allow us to simulate from a fair coin and we could change the starting value of <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> and 
have no affect.</p>

<p>What would happen however, if we started simulating this Markov chain and then changed the value of <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>.
Well initially both states 1 and 2 would be equally likely by symmetry but when I change <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>, lets say 
made it bigger, then the state the chain is in when <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> becomes bigger
will now be less likely than the other state. Overall, our chain will no longer
be simulating from a fair coin. This is despite the fact that if we first fixed <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>
to any value and then simulated with that fixed <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>, we’d always simulate a fair coin.</p>

<p>This shows that care must be taken when adapting transitions during MCMC. For most chains
we can guarantee that adaptation wont break our sampler as long as the amount of adaptation tends to <script type="math/tex">0</script> as 
the length of the chain tends to infinity. This criterion is known as “vanishing adaptation”. In general
we should use adaptation with caution.</p>
